## Projects
###  SWE-MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute Build a CubeSat Challenge
[Presentation](https://youtu.be/uKBevOst0bA)

- Designed and fabricated a 1U CubeSat with a Raspberry Pi camera to capture high-resolution images of water environments, using a 
 machine learning model trained on 200+ labeled images to identify plastic debris 
- Implemented data compression algorithms, reducing image file sizes by 50% and enabling rapid transmission of 10 images to the 
 ground station in 2.3 seconds via Bluetooth 
- Conducted 50+ simulated ocean tests, integrating telemetry tools for real-time monitoring of acceleration, orientation, and battery 
 status, achieving 80% accuracy in detecting and boxing plastic debris.
